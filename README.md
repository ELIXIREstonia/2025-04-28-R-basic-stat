# 2025-02-18-R-basic-stat

ELIXIR-EE training course on introduction to statistics in R. This course is designed to provide researchers in biomedical sciences with experience in the application of basic statistical analysis techniques to a variety of biological problems. The course extensively covers materials from https://sib-swiss.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics-with-R/



This course is a mixture of lectures and practicals. The main files for practising are the [2025-02-18-R-basic-stat.Rmd](2025-02-18-R-basic-stat.Rmd) and [day_2.zip](day_2.zip). R markdown allows code (examples) and explanation / documentation to be in the same document in a nicely formatted, well structured manner.

Data files needed in the code are located in the `data` folder.

The lecture slides are found in [https://zenodo.org/records/14883678](https://zenodo.org/records/14883678)

Learning outcomes:

1.  **Have experience applying basic statistics techniques in R**:

    -   Learners will be able use R to run appropriate statistical tests and visualize these results.

2.  **Summarize data with numerical and graphical summaries**:

    -   Participants will gain proficiency in ggplot library and learn to summarize data.

3.  **Understanding basic concepts in statistics: one/two/multiple-sample tests, hypothesis testing, multiple testing correction etc.**:

    -   Trainees will be equipped with the knowledge about which statistical test to apply and when, how to do hypothesis testing in biological context and when to apply multiple testing.

4.  **Learn about the relations in the data using correlation, regression**:

    -   Learners will find out about relations between features in data.
      
5.  **Understand how to deal with categorical data in statistics**:

    -   Learners will gain understanding about how to find statistical significant associations in categorical data.
